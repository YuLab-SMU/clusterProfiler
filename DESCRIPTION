Description: This package supports functional characteristics of both coding and non-coding genomics data for thousands of species with up-to-date gene annotation. It provides a univeral interface for gene functional annotation from a variety of sources and thus can be applied in diverse scenarios. It provides a tidy interface to access, manipulate, and visualize enrichment results to help users achieve efficient data interpretation. Datasets obtained from multiple treatments and time points can be analyzed and compared in a single run, easily revealing functional consensus and differences among distinct conditions.
